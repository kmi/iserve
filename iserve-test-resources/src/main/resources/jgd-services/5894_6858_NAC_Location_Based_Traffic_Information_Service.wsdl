                            intersection, etc.) of where the incident is occurring.
                            * Created: The date and time when the traffic incident data was created in Pacific Time,
                            regardless of the location of the traffic incident.
                            * Divert: Specifies whether this incident is causing a traffic diversion. Values are either
                            True or False.
                            * ExpectedDelay: The estimated traffic slowdown caused by the incident.
                            * ExpectedDuration: The estimated amount of time that the incident will persist.
                            * FullDescription: A full comment of the traffic incident.
                            * LastUpdated: The date and time when the traffic incident data was last updated in Pacific
                            Time, regardless of the location of the traffic incident.
                            * Severity: The severity of the incident. Values for this property include Severe, High,
                            Medium, Low, and Unknown.
                            * StandardMessage: A brief comment of the incident type.
                            * TrafficAreaID: The EntityID of the TrafficArea polygon which contains this incident.
