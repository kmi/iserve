boundaries are relatively stable but whose constitutive material is
continuously moving through the region itself and being replaced by
other, similar material.  Each FlowRegion is constituted by a stream
of matter moving as a whole.  A FlowRegion may be liquid or gaseous.
A wind may be considered as a Process or as a FlowRegion, similarly
an ocean current or a WaterWave.  Note that certain
properties belong to the FlowRegion itself (e.g., mass, length, volume,
temperature, and speed or velocity of the region moving as a whole),
while other properties of interest belong to the Motion of its
constitutive stuff (e.g., velocity, direction).  The motion of
a FlowRegion as a whole (e.g. the jet stream moves within the atmosphere)
is distinguished from the motion of the pieces of stuff constituting the
FlowRegion.</rdfs:comment>

radioisotopes of gold, Au-195 being the most stable with a half-life of
186 days.  Gold is used as a monetary standard, in jewelry, dentistry,
electronics.  Au-198 is used in treating cancer and some other medical
conditions.  Gold has been known to exist as far back as 2600 BC.  Gold
comes from the Anglo-Saxon word gold.  Its symbol, Au, comes from the
Latin word aurum, which means gold.  Gold is not particularly toxic,
however it is known to cause damage to the liver and kidneys in 
some.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Attractive greyish-white metal.  When pure, it is

{Hydrogen} and {oxygen} react explosively in the presence of platinum.
There are six stable isotopes and three radioisotopes, the most stable
being Pt-193 with a half-life of 60 years.  Platinum is used in jewelry,
laboratory equipment, electrical contacts, dentistry, and anti-pollution
devices in cars.  PtCl2(NH3)2 is used to treat some forms of cancer.
Platinum-{cobalt} alloys have magnetic properties.  It is also used in the
definition of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode.  Discovered by Antonio de
Ulloa in South America in 1735.  The name comes from the Spanish word
platina which means silver.  Platinum metal is generally not a health
concern due to its unreactivity, however platinum compounds should be
considered highly toxic.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>SI electric conductance measure.  Symbol:  S.
In the case of direct current, the conductance in Siemens is the
reciprocal of the resistance in Ohms; in the case of alternating current,
it is the reciprocal of the impedance in ohms.  siemens = A/V =

<rdfs:comment>SI dose equivalent measure.  Symbol: Sv.  It is
a unit of biologic dose of ionizing radiation.  The Sievert makes it
possible to normalize doses of different types of radiation. It takes
into account the relative biologic effectiveness of ionizing radiation,
since each form of such radiation--e.g., X rays, gamma rays, neutrons--
has a slightly different effect on living tissue for a given absorbed
dose. The dose equivalent of a given type of radiation (in Sievert) is
the dose of the radiation in Gray multiplied by a quality factor that
is based on the relative biologic effectiveness of the radiation.
Accordingly, one Sievert is generally defined as the amount of radiation
roughly equivalent in biologic effectiveness to one Gray of gamma
radiation.  Sievert = J/kg = m^2*s^(-2)</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Signalling is the subclass of Guiding
processes in which an agent, animate or inanimate, sends a signal to
another Object.  In many cases, this signal will be an electrical or
electronic one.  Some signals may directly control the behavior of
the object signalled, while others may merely cause information to be
presented.  Instances of electrical Signalling are typically more
complex than simply than operation of a DeviceSwitch, though in some
cases, Signalling involves remote activation of such a switch by another
device.</rdfs:comment>
